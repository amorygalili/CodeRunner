# Robot Starter

A minimal WPILib command-based robot wired up with [AdvantageKit](https://docs.advantagekit.org)
logging. This is your starting point for writing robot code that runs in
simulation.

## Running it

Click the **Run** button in the CodeRunner Driver Station to build and start the
robot in simulation. Telemetry shows up in AdvantageScope and the Driver Station
panel as the robot runs.

## Where the code lives

The robot's behavior is defined in `src/main/java/frc/robot/`:

- `RobotContainer.java` — **write your code here.** This is where you wire up
  subsystems, commands, and controller bindings. Its `robotPeriodic()` method
  runs every loop.
- `Robot.java` — sets up AdvantageKit logging and calls
  `RobotContainer.robotPeriodic()`. You shouldn't need to edit it.
- `Constants.java` — selects the AdvantageKit runtime mode (sim vs. replay).

The starter logs a counter that increments every loop and a robot pose that
drives in a circle, both through AdvantageKit's `Logger.recordOutput(...)`, so
you can confirm that edit → run → telemetry is working end to end. Edit
`RobotContainer.java`, click Run, and watch your changes appear in AdvantageScope.

## The Robot Dashboard tab

This lesson also ships a small custom dashboard: open the **Robot Dashboard**
tab next to AdvantageScope to see the loop counter and the robot's pose update
live while the robot runs. It is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the
`dashboard/` folder, declared in `.coderunner/dashboards.json`. Try adding
another value you log from `RobotContainer.java` to it, then click **Reload**
in the tab.
