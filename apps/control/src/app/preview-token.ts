 * Preview iframes are sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`, so their document
 * has an opaque origin. Browsers compute a null site-for-cookies for such a
 * document, which means the `SameSite=Lax` session cookie is dropped from every
 * subresource request and in-frame navigation the framed report makes — the
 * document itself loads (that navigation is parent-initiated) but its CSS, JS,
 * images and page links would all come back unauthenticated.
 *
 * So the grant travels in the URL path instead of in a cookie. A report's links
 * are relative, so the browser rebuilds every follow-up URL from the current
 * one and the token segment is inherited for free — the report never has to
 * know it exists.
 *
 * The token authorises reading one workspace's project tree, expires quickly,
 * and is only ever handed to the owner of that workspace. Responses that carry
 * it set `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `Cache-Control: no-store` so it does
 * not leak outward or linger in a shared cache.
